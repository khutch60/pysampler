<h1 style="font-weight: bold">Introduction</h1>
<p>Hello and thank you for taking interest in my music sampler/drum machine.  The GUI and audio playback is all handled in pygame.  Pydub is used to handle he pitch shifting of audio samples.</p>
<a href="https://youtu.be/oK9aFNh6kLE">Click here for a rundown of the program as well as a little sound demo</a>

<h2 style="font-weight: bold">Getting Started</h2>
<p>There are eight total tracks you can use.  Each track can load up to eight different samples.  Press the select button to load a sample on any track.</p>

<p>On the left side of each track you will see an up and down button.  Above these buttons will be another button labeled either pitch or volume.</p>

<p>Click volume/pitch to toggle between modes.  Volume, as would suggest, will control the volume of the row it used on.  Pitch will raise or lower the pitch of each sample by a half step.  This means you can use one sample on multiple rows at different pitches, negating the need for multiple samples for different chords/notes.</p>

<p>Click the mode button to toggle between instrument and drum mode.  Each track can be set to its own mode.</p>
<p>Drum mode is self explanatory.  When a sample is triggered it will be played in its entirety.  Instrument mode, however, will only play the sample for the duration specified.  While in instrument mode, you can click and drag your note holds.</p>

<p>In the bottom left, you can adjust the bpm of the track, as well as the number of steps.  You can also select which measure you are viewing depending on the number of steps selected.</p>

<p>In the bottom right you can play, save, or load a project.</p>

<p>Press reset to start a new project.  Be aware that clicking reset will completely reset everything including your selected samples.  Make sure you save your project beforehand.</p>
